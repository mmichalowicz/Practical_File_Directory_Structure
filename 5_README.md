# Practical File Directory Structure

1. Create a <root> directory
   - Based on your "role" (example: c:\dev)
   - Based on your "name" (example: c:\Mike)
   - Based on your social media tag: (example: c:\VideoGamur)
2. Create the following directories:
   1. "1_To Organize"
   2. "2_To Not Forget"
   3. "3_BACKUP"
   4. "4_Temporary"
3. Whenever you need  to receive files to you OR whenever you need to send files, start by
   1. Go to your <root> directory
   2. Important: Always sort the contents by "Name" (which will ensure the directories are in the correct order), ALWAYS when opening folder
   3. Visually scan through the list top to bottom for where the file is that you are trying to receive or send
4. Do whatever you need to do with the file

# Understanding the Structure

- ONLY when you understand the structure and have tried this a couple times
  - Go to the <root> directory
  - Add a "5_Enjoy"
